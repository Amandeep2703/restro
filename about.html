                        Dal makhni, dal tadka, mah di daal, shahi paneer, matar paneer, kadhai paneer, kadhi pakoda,
                        rajma, chhole, chhole paneer â€” you name it and Amrik Da Dhaba has it. Manpreet Singh, the owner
                        of the dhaba, is equally adept at rattling off the names of all the dishes that the dhaba
                        offers.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Located on the busy Mehna Chowk, Amrik Da Dhaba is a haven for all those who stay alone in the
                        city and also for those who want to have food which is great on taste and light on the pocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The dhaba, which was opened in the year 1978 by Manpreet's father Amrik Singh, has also long
                        been the favourite of many in the city who believe in nocturnal outings. "We stay open till late
                        and sometimes I eat dinner with a few of our loyal customers. One of our customers was with a
                        media firm. He used to have his dinner with me every night. I also used to wait for him. That's
                        the love we share with our customers," says Manpreet proudly.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Manpreet shares that another reason for the popularity of the dhaba is the fact that it has four
                        types of dals and at least 22 types of vegetables on its menu apart from other side dishes and
                        breakfast items.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        "Our parantha and raita combination is a hit with the customers. Kadhi pakoda is another item
                        which sells like hot cakes. Rajma and chhole are an all-time favourite. Our USP lies in the fact
                        that while the dishes have been priced reasonably, we don't compromise with the quantity of
                        servings and the quality of our preparations," shares Manpreet.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Manpreet followed in his father's footsteps and says he wouldn't mind if his son does the same.
                        "My father came from Peshawar and lived his life in Bathinda. I assisted him and wouldn't mind
                        if my son does the same if he wants. But like all parents, I have bigger dreams for him. As a
                        father, I would like to develop the dhaba into a full-fledged hotel for him to handle," says
                        Manpreet.
